# Job Portal Discrimination Webapp

This webapp is designed to identify bias and discrimination in job descriptions on job portals. It uses an advanced machine learning model trained on thousands of job descriptions to detect any form of bias. 

## Project Overview

The app scrapes job descriptions from various portals, processes the text, and feeds it to a pre-trained BERT model for sequence classification. The model then identifies whether the description contains any biased language or not.

## Features

- Job scraping from various job portals
- Text classification using a pre-trained BERT model
- MongoDB integration for storing scraped data
- Streamlit web app for easy interaction
